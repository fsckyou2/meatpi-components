/**
 * @file http_client_manager.h
 * @brief WiCAN HTTP(S) client owner (service component).
 *
 * The one way components do HTTP-client work (rewrite of the legacy
 * https_client_mgr): synchronous request/response with TLS, auth
 * helpers, and download-to-filesystem. Consumers: autopid cloud posts,
 * web-asset fetch-on-miss, future integrations.
 *
 * THREAD SAFETY (the point of the "manager"): every request builds its
 * own esp_http_client instance on the CALLER's task (no shared mutable
 * state between requests) and a counting semaphore caps concurrent
 * requests (default 4) so many tasks can't exhaust sockets/TLS heap;
 * excess callers briefly block. Calls are SYNCHRONOUS and can take
 * seconds (network): call from ordinary tasks only, never from ISRs,
 * timer callbacks, or event handlers that must not block (mqtt/imu/
 * battery handler contexts included).
 *
 * CALLER STACK REQUIREMENT (found the hard way on the bench):
 * https:// requests run the mbedTLS handshake on YOUR stack, budget
 * ≥8 KB (a 4 KB task stack-overflowed and panicked). download() is
 * stack-agnostic: all media writes run on the manager's own
 * internal-stack writer task, so PSRAM-stack callers are fine.
 *
 * TLS: `https://` URLs verify against, in priority order, a
 * cert_manager SET (`cert_set`, CA + optional client pair = mutual
 * TLS, same model as mqtt_manager) > explicit PEM fields > the built-in
 * certificate bundle.
 *
 * Responses are capped (default 16 KB, config override ≤256 KB) into a
 * PSRAM buffer owned by the caller via http_client_manager_free().
